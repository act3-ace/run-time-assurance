# Run Time Assurance Concepts

## Introduction

Run Time Assurance (RTA) is an online safety assurance technique that filters potentially unsafe inputs from a primary controller in a way that preserves safety of the system when necessary. RTA is designed to be completely independent of the primary control structure, such that it can be used with any control system. 

## Modeling Dynamical Control Systems

This module supports dynamical control systems, where $x$ 

<!-- $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the state vector of size $n$ and $\boldsymbol{u}\in \mathcal{U} \subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ denotes the control vector of size $m$. -->
